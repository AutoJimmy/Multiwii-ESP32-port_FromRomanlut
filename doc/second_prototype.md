Second prototype

Second prototype is based on Eachine E58 motors.
The goal was to build super compact foldable drone.
Case is 3D printed. Case is designed to have as little weight a possible.
I tried to mimic original Eachine E58 shape, but in order to make it 3d-priter fiendly, 
parts should not have overhang parts. 
Originally was controlled by Sony PS3 controller. Later added HX-ESPNOW-RC.

Hower current is ~4.5A. 
Total weight is 90g. 900mAh lipo is 23g.
Flying time ~10 minutes.
